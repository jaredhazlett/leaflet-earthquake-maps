# leaflet-earthquake-maps
This project plots earthquakes across the globe. The size of the markers are dependent on the magnitude of the earthquake, while the colors are dependent on the depth of the quake. 

You can choose different modes on which to view the hourly quake markers - Street Map, Dark Map(as shown below), Light Map or Gray Map. 
You can also toggle the earthquake markers on/off.
